# Social Media Web App Deployment to AKS

This project demonstrates the deployment of a MERN social media web application to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using Azure DevOps for CI/CD. The pipeline automates building, testing, and deploying the application to AKS, ensuring scalability and streamlined updates. The infrastructure is containerized with Docker, and Kubernetes is used for orchestration, providing a robust platform for managing the app in a production environment.
